# Tiny Python Projects

This repository contains codes from the "Tiny Python Projects" Book by Ken Youens-Clark. Here i used WSL command line and VS Code in writing python programs. The repository consists of a directory for each chapter in the tiny python project, each directory also contains a test script which you can use in checking that your codes are correct and running well.

## Getting Started and installations
* I began this project by first installing pip on my python environmen with the command **sudo apt install python3-pip**
* Then i installed virtualenv using the command **python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv**
* I created my stutern virtual environment using the command **python3 -m virtualenv stutern_env**
* I then activated the environment using **source stutern_env/bin/activate**
* I installed the necessarry packages using **python3 -m pip install black flake8 ipython mypy pylint pytest yapf**
