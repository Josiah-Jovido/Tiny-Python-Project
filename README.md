# Tiny Python Projects

This repository contains codes from the "Tiny Python Projects" Book by Ken Youens-Clark. Here i used WSL command line and VS Code in writing python programs. The repository consists of a directory for each chapter in the tiny python project, each directory also contains a test script which you can use in checking that your codes are correct and running well.
